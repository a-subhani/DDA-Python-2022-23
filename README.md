# CodeLab II (CCO5000-20)
# Data Driven Application - Assignment 2

## Brief

For this assignment you are tasked with developing an application that makes use of data retrieved from an API. Your application should demonstrate the use functions, and pass arguments between these as appropriate. Where possible, the application should also implement object oriented programming techniques.

The final application should be delivered via a functioning interactive GUI built using Tkinter. This GUI should allow the user to interact via mouse and/or keyboard input.

You are required to use one of the APIs listed below:

* [The Cocktail Database](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
* [The Sports Database](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php)
* [The Audio Database](https://theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php)
* [The Meal Database](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
* [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/)
* [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/)

How you use the chosen API and the functionality you provide within your application is up to you. Making creative use of the API and/or providing the user with a range of options to query the API will likely afford higher marks. You should explore the documentation for each API to see what is possible in order to help select the API you wish to work with.
